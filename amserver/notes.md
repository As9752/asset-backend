## Model 
Notes:

MongoDB uses BSON, a binary representation of JSON, to store data. Therefore, the @Id field is typically a String (which will hold the ObjectId from MongoDB) or can be of type ObjectId from the MongoDB driver.

MongoDB is schema-less, so you don't need to define foreign key relationships like in relational databases. However, you can still reference other documents by their IDs.

If you have complex nested structures, consider creating embedded documents or additional classes to represent them.

For more complex operations, you can use Spring Data MongoDB's MongoRepository to create repository interfaces for each of your entities.
